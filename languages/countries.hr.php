/*
 * The following table lists alternate names for various Chapman codes.
 * It will be used when country names have to be converted to Chapman codes.
 * You do not have to list all the possibilities in all page languages.  This
 * will be done automatically by the country-to-Chapman conversion routine.
 *
 * Because the list, and its contents, are specific to each language, the 
 * Translator Tool won't let you work on the list directly.  The list will
 * have to be updated and amended manually.
 *
 * Suppose Chapman code "XYZ" represents the same country, and that country 
 * had the names "Name1", "Name2", "Name3" in its history.  It is now known
 * as "Current name".  You can list the various names like this:
 *
 * ##$countries["XYZ"]="Current name";
 * $altCountryName["XYZ"]="Name1; Name2; Name3";
 *
 * The Chapman-to-country conversion will always use the $countries list of
 * the current page language, no matter what the original country name was.
